# My Library

My Library is an app developed to help keep track of the bookson your shelf! It will keep a comprehensive list, that you can sort by what you have read and what you need to read still. You will be able to search for your books and add them to your library and designate where on the shelf they need to go. Create a wish list for the books you would like to own/read next! View what others are reading to see if they have anything that peeks your interesst and add it to your list!
